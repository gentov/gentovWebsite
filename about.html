		Who am I? I'm an engineer who does his best to make sure things go "kaboom" as little as possible (unless they're intended to). I love seeing systems move for the first time! I graduated with high distinction from Worcester Polytechnic Institute 
		with degrees in Robotics Engineering and Electrical & Computer Engineering, before working towards my Master's degree in Robotics Engineering. I was the recruitment officer for WPI's robotics engineering honors society, a member of WPI's orchestra, 
		and vice-president of the WPI tennis team. I've held internships at MIT, MITRE, Sensata Technologies, and most recently Vecna Robotics, and can't wait to get out into the industry full-time in December 2020. I also speak Russian and am working 
		am (slowly) working on my Spanish.

		Outside of class, I love playing tennis (when New England weather permits), playing the violin, and exploring new places (can you guess where my home page photo was taken?). Want to know more? Drop me a line at gentov97@gmail.com!
