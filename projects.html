        <h3> Kinisi: A Platform for Autonomizing Off-Road Vehicles </h3>
        <article> For my engineering capstone, I worked on autonomizing
          an off-road baja vehicle. I developed the entire electrical
          system and all of the embedded software for the vehicle. I
          developed the communication network between nodes responsible
          for actuating the vehicle. I also helped develop the decision
          making algorithms, leveraging data fusion and computer vision
          to help the vehicle navigate. I also developed some of the
          mechanical system that gave the embedded system feedback as to
          where the steering was. The autonomous system can be turned
          off, and the vehicle retains full human driving operability as
          well as steering and braking capabilities. The long-term goal
          of this project, outside of the scope of this team’s one year
          timeline, was for the baja vehicle to be able to navigate
          through off road terrain in order to rescue and provide aid to
          a distressed individual. The project took home first place in
          the Electrical and Computer Engineering departments judging of
          capstone projects! You can find the entire report <a

        <h3> Software Engineering Project </h3>
        <article> I was part of a ten-person student team working in a
          class competition to apply Agile development methodologies and
          software design patterns in Java to create (1) an online
          alcohol label submission form for manufacturers, (2) a form
          processing workflow application for US Treasury agents in the
          Alcohol and Tobacco Tax &amp; Trade Bureau (TTB), and (3) an
          alcohol beverage search engine for the general public. The
          software systems we created were to inform the TTB about
          potential features, user interfaces, and design approaches
          that they might consider implementing. <br>
          <br>
          As a software engineer, I helped gather software requirements
          by creating surveys and interviews, and brainstorming with the
          team, as well as creating user stories, scenarios and
          storyboards. I was responsible for implementing the "special
          feature" components of the application, that set our team
          apart from other teams in the class. I implemented security
          features, as well as some time-saving features like showing
          changes (similar to git-diff) to the agents so that they would
          not have to review the application entirely again. I also
          implemented some hardware features such as RFID login, and
          some CV features using the Tesseract OCR to read alcohol
          labels.<br>

        <h3> Autonomous Robot Navigation Project</h3>
        <article> As part of WPI's undergraduate robotics curriculum, I
          took a robotics class covering autonomous robot navigation
          using SLAM and the Robot Operating System (ROS) to program the
          robot to map and explore a maze. This class entailed
          demonstrating correct implementation of robot control,
          occupancy grid "padding", and the A* search algorithm to
          autonomously navigate around obstacles. Feel free to view the
          final report <a

        <h3> Robot Manipulation Project</h3>
        <article> As part of a three person team, I've helped program 3
          Degree of Freedom arms to accomplish a sorting task using
          computer vision and MATLAB, to show what the robot is seeing,
          and to plot the robot’s motion in real time. This was my first
          real introduction to forward and inverse position and velocity
          kinematics, as well as PID. The goal of this project was to
          have the robot arm pick up objects of different color and
          weight, and sort them accordingly. On one side it would place
          light objects, and on the other, it would place heavy objects.
          Each color on each side had its own place. I had a lot of fun
          making this silly video of it working as well! Feel free to

        <h3> Real Time Tennis Match Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
        <article> Being the avid tennis lover that I am, I worked on a
          team to create a program to predict the outcome of tennis
          matches before the match using Logistic Regression. It was
          74.5% correct out of 2801 matches before the match had even
          begun. We then updated prediction throughout the match using
          SVM. The merged algorithms yielded 76% correct predictions
          before 50% of the match was complete, and was 97.2% correct by
          the end. This program was able to actually predict some
          serious upsets in the ATP Nitto Finals tournament! Feel free

        <h3> Path Planning Visualizer</h3>
        <article> I had an assignment to implement a few search
          algorithms for my Motion Planning class, but having finished a
          bit early, I decided to make an interface that visualizes the
          algorithms finding the path from start to finish, and also
          added the ability to drop obstacles in the world. As of right
          now, the algorithms it can do are: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, A*,
          and Weighted A*, but I would like to at RRT and some other
          sample based path planning algorithms in the future! You can
          find the code on my <a
            href="https://github.com/gentov/RBE550-SearchAlgorithms">GitHub</a>.
          Let me know if you have ideas for new features! <br>

        <h3> Park My Car </h3>
        <article> After taking a class on Artificial Intelligence, I was
          pretty blown away, and so in the break between semesters, I
          wrote a small program to visualize the genetic algorithm when
          applied to a car learning to park in a parking space. How much
          a car is rewarded depends on how close it is to the parking
          spot, as well as how well it is oriented, and whether or not
          it hit the two cars on either side of the parking spot.
          Eventually, I want to improve the program with a neural
          network. You can find the code here {INSERT LINK HERE]. It's
          still very much a work in progress, with images coming soon! </article>

        <h3> A Greener Venice: The Inventory and Reutilization of Green
          Spaces on the Giudecca Island </h3>
        <article> I was lucky enough to do my study abroad in Venice,
          Italy, where I worked on a team of four to asses the
          under-utilized land on the Giudecca Island in Italy. Our study
          identified and classified green spaces on the island, we
          developed a methodology to classify each of the green spaces
          as an Urban Wild, Park, Private Garden, or Farmland, and
          proposed options for reutilization. This methodology can be
          implemented in other parts of Venice or its Lagoon. If
          implemented, our recommendations for reutilization on Giudecca
          would increase usable land by 31%, ultimately making for a
          more sustainable and greener Venice. In order for other
          researchers to continue our work, I developed a QGIS plug-in
          that classified the best way to re-utilize the unused land (at
          least according to our methodologies). We also made a google
          map of our findings <a
